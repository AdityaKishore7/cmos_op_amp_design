# Two-Stage Miller-Compensated Operational Amplifier Design

## Project Description

This project involves the design and simulation of a two-stage Miller-compensated operational amplifier (op-amp) with a capacitive load. The goal is to achieve specified design criteria and performance parameters, using simulation software such as ADS or LTSpice. The designed op-amp will be evaluated based on several key specifications, including transistor dimensions, DC gain, input common mode range, phase margin, and gain-bandwidth product.

## Task Specifications

**Design Objectives:**
- **DC Gain:** Achieve a DC gain of 2000.
- **Input Common Mode Range:** The range should be from 0.7 V to 1.6 V.
- **Phase Margin:** Ensure a phase margin greater than 60 degrees for a capacitive load of 5 pF.
- **Gain-Bandwidth Product:** Target a gain-bandwidth product of 50 MHz.
- **Transistor Dimensions:** Use reasonable lengths and widths for NMOS transistors and report these dimensions.
